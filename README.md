rross
=====

R script for Ross' pet projects. A lot of vividnumeral.com number crunching is done here.

Most scripts have a HOMEDIR variable. That needs to be set to the directory of the repo on your local machine to work.
For example, on my machine the repo lives in C:/Users/Ross/Documents/R/rross. So I set:
```
HOMEDIR <- "C:/Users/Ross/Documents/R/rross"
```
